## Titles On Hold

In the Titles on Hold section, you are able to see a combined view of titles on hold or click on each format individually. This section is also split into holds that are ready for pickup and holds that are pending. 

The holds that are ready for pickup can be canceled and the holds that are pending have the option to be frozen or canceled as well and for physical material, you have the option to change the pickup location. You are also able to see similar items based on those titles while you wait. These lists can also be sorted and covers hidden and at the bottom of the page you can also export this list to excel.

You are also able to see library hours here.
