## Masquerade Mode

To use Masquerade Mode, you will first need to turn on Masquerade Mode in Library Systems -> ILS/Account Integration -> Masquerade Mode. Once you have allowed masquerade mode, assigned an automatic timeout length, and decided on allowing the display of reading history in Masquerade Mode, you will need to make sure that masquerade permissions have been assigned for patron types and administrators that will be using this function.

To enter Masquerade Mode, click on the link in the Account drop-down menu then enter the barcode of the patron that you would like to Masquerade as. Once you are done, you will need to end Masquerade by clicking on "End Masquerade" in the account drop-down menu. If your library is set up for automatic timeout, you will have the option to continue, end masquerade, or log out completely.
