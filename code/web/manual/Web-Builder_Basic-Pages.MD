## Web Builder - Basic Pages

The Basic Page builder allows you to create simple pages by adding a title, a URL alias (that can be entered as-is for menu links), a teaser, and the basic page contents. In the contents section, you can add headers, images, links, quotes, and lists by using the buttons at the top of the Page Contents box, or by using Markdown language.

You can then select the audience and categories for this page to appear in searches and select which library this page has been created for.
