- You will need to give a path within AR Export Path, FTP Server URL, FTP Username, and FTP password. If you do not want Aspen to generate AR specific subject information you can uncheck the check boxes for 'Index Series' and 'Index indexSubjects'.
  - For AR export path use: data/aspen-discovery/accelerated_reader

- Once AR is integrated, you will have the ability to narrow searches by AR data
