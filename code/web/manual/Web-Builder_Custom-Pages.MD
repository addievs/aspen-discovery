## Web Builder - Custom Pages

Custom pages are built using a more advanced, cell-based layout than basic pages. You are able to add the title and choose a URL Alias, as well as select the audience, categories, and libraries to view this page, but the way the page is built is based on adding cells and rows.

After adding a cell, click on the penicl icon to edit the page. Here you will be able to select the layout settings, source type, and contents. The contents box is similar to the basic page, and you can add headers, lists, quotes, images, and text using Markdown language.
