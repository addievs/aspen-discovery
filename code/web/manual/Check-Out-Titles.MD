## Checked Out Titles

Items that have been checked out by the patron will be visible by the patron in their account. The link for checked out titles can be found in the patron account drop down menu or on the left-hand side of the patron account.

In the checked out titles section, patrons are able to see a combined view of material that has been checked out, as well as tabs for each format so that you can easily see your eBooks through Overdrive, or Hoopla, and you can also just go straight to your physical material so that itâ€™s nice and clear what items need to be returned online and which need to be brought back to the library. 

These can be sorted, and covers hidden at the top. You can also interact with each item on this page, including reading or listening online, downloading RBdigital material, returning the item, or choosing a format.You can also view similar titles and click on the record to show the record display. At the bottom of the page, you can also renew selected items that have boxes next to the item, renew all, or export this list to excel.
